Unit 3: Display lists and use Material Design

A small app I created to meet the following brief:

"To help reinforce what you learned in this unit, it is now your turn to use your new skills and abilities to create an app of your own!"

The general app guidelines are:

Decide on a theme and create 30 tips related to this theme. One tip for each day of the month.
At a minimum, each tip should contain relevant text and an image.
The tips need to be displayed in a scrollable list (column or row) or a scrollable grid.
Follow Material Design guidelines to create a distinct brand for the app.
Make it unique! Make it special to you by showcasing what you learned! This is your chance to take an idea of your own from concept to reality.
